# Introduction
Console application that would parse a log csv file and print out logs based on a custom query.

## TODO
* search any column by full string.
* search any column by partial string.
* Query provided by user input
* Format as your choice in example: [SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name = 'search_string']
* Results from the query should be combined and returned in JSON format
*[x] Please provide project folder structure.

### Bonus: 
* Add Boolean logical operator support in the queries (AND, OR, NOT...);
*[x] Add multiple file support;
* Add log count value in the resulting JSON output;

### More bonus points:

* Improvements are welcome 😊. For example, Deal with duplicates, combine results in a more readable format.
* Implement database layer. Save results in a database of your choice.
* Implement options to send alerts based on the severity of the log. No need to actually send the notification, you can use Console.WriteLine().
* Dynamic log parsing. Logs can have different columns, how would you attend to this?
